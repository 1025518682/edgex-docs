## Introduction

The Virtual Device Service simulates different kinds of devices to
generate Events and Readings to Core Data Microservice and Users can
send commands and get responses through the Command and Control
Microservice. The ability to do these activities is very useful when
executing functional or performance tests without any real devices. This
version of Virtual Device Service is implemented based on the Device
Service SDK.
